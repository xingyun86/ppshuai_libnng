== NAME

nng_tcp_free - free TCP connection

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>
#include <nng/supplemental/tcp/tcp.h>

void nng_tcp_free(nng_tcp *conn);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_tcp_free()` function closes the supplied TCP connection, _conn_,
and frees the underlying resources associated with it.

If any operations are pending (such as `<<nng_tcp_send.3tcp#,nng_tcp_send()>>`
or `<<nng_tcp_recv.3tcp#,nng_tcp_recv()>>` they will be terminated with
an `NNG_ECLOSED` error condition.

WARNING: It is important that the application ensure that no further accesses
are made to _conn_, as the memory backing it will be reclaimed for other uses.

NOTE: Closing the connection while data is in transmission will likely
lead to loss of that data.
There is no automatic linger or flush to ensure that the socket send buffers
have completely transmitted.

== RETURN VALUES

None.

== ERRORS

None.
